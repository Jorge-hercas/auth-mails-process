# auth-mails-process
Repository designed to provide the necessary codes for a process of extracting, transforming and loading data into another file (ETL process).

This process is basically divided into 3 phases: Renaming invoices and sending them by mail in a massive way, after that, extracting information from other emails to paste it into an excel file and, finally, extracting an ID from the PDF invoices using a regular expression to add it in the excel file.

As it contains sensitive information, I am not going to share the key of my email or real invoice data, this repository is merely illustrative to understand the process and the logic behind it.
